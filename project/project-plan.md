## Title
Exploring the Links Between Population Growth, CO2 Emissions, and Climate Change

## Main Question
1. How does population distribution and density influence the climate impact of CO2 emissions across different regions?

## Datasources

### Datasource 1: Agri-food CO2 emission dataset
* Meta Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml
* Data URL: [Kaggle - Agri-food CO2 emission dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml )

The agricultural sector is a significant contributor to climate change. This dataset plays a crucial role in understanding and monitoring the impact of agricultural activities on CO2 emissions. 7k rows and 31 columns. The dataset used for the study on CO2 emissions and temperature change for each country from 1990 to 2020. All the emission were recorded in kilotones (kt): 1kt = 1000 kg.


### Datasource 2: World Population Data
* Meta Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/2023-world-population-by-country
* World Population by Country: [2023 World Population](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/2023-world-population-by-country)

The US Census Bureau's world population clock estimated that the global population as of September 2022 was 7,922,312,800 people and was expected to reach 8 billion by mid-November of 2022. This total far exceeds the 2015 world population of 7.2 billion. The world's population continues to increase by roughly 140 people per minute, with births outweighing deaths in most countries.
