# Project Plan

## Title: Climate Change Reasons: Co2 Emission and Deforestation

## Main Question

* How does Co2 emission impact climate?
* How is rising temperature related with climate change?
* what is the corelation of both datasets and combine effect on climate change?

## Description

<!-- will update later-->

## Datasources: 

### Datasource: Agri-food CO2 emission dataset
* Data URL: [Kaggle - Agri-food CO2 emission dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml )
* Meta Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml

The agricultural sector is a significant contributor to climate change. This dataset plays a crucial role in understanding and monitoring the impact of agricultural activities on CO2 emissions. 7k rows and 31 columns. The dataset used for the study on CO2 emissions and temperature change for each country from 1990 to 2020. All the emission were recorded in kilotones (kt): 1kt = 1000 kg.


### Datasource: Rising Temperature
* Rising Surface Temperature: [Average Temperature Rise](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-monthly-surface-temperature?tab=table)
* Meta Data: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/monthly-temperature-anomalies
* Data Type:CSV
